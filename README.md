# Hi there, I'm Nuno Valdez ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate web developer based in Portugal, leveraging JavaScript and its myriad frameworks (ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, NestJS, NextJS) to craft dynamic and responsive web applications. For me, programming is not just about writing codeâ€”it's about solving problems and making the world a better place, one line of code at a time.


## ðŸŒ± My Journey

Before diving into the world of web development, I embarked on a career in dentistry as a Dental Technician. This experience honed my soft skills, teaching me the value of attention to detail, focus, determination, and commitment. Transitioning from dentistry to tech, I've found that the analytical and problem-solving skills required in biology and dentistry are surprisingly analogous to those in development. Every time people express surprise at my career shift, I highlight how both fields demand a similar mindset: a deep curiosity about how things work and a relentless pursuit of solutions. These qualities have been instrumental in my transition to tech, where I blend technical proficiency with empathy and creativity.


## ðŸ’¼ What I Do

As a developer who is always curious and eager to learn, I've embraced the challenges of working with various JavaScript frameworks. While I may have a junior title, my approach and dedication reflect a senior mindset. I believe in using technology as a tool for positive change, striving to create solutions that are not only efficient but also accessible and user-friendly.


## ðŸš€ Why I Love What I Do

- **Problem Solving**: At heart, I'm a problem solver. Whether it's debugging a complex application or finding innovative ways to meet user needs, I thrive on overcoming challenges.
- **Continuous Learning**: The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me on my toes, always learning and adapting to new tools and frameworks.
- **Making an Impact**: I'm driven by the belief that technology can make a difference, improving lives and connecting communities.
