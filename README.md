# Hi there, I'm Nuno Valdez 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate **Software Web Developer** based in Portugal, leveraging JavaScript and its myriad frameworks (ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, NestJS, NextJS) to craft dynamic and responsive web applications. For me, programming is not just about writing code—it's about solving problems and making a difference, one line of code at a time.

## 🌱 My Journey

From a Dental Technician to a **Web Developer**, my path has been unconventional. The precision and problem-solving skills from my dentistry days have seamlessly translated into coding, where solving puzzles and building solutions are daily tasks. This shift might surprise some, but it's taught me that at the core of both fields is a deep curiosity and a drive to improve lives. This unique background fuels my approach to technology, blending empathy, creativity, and technical expertise.




## 💼 What I Do

As a developer who is always curious and eager to learn, I've embraced the challenges of working with various JavaScript frameworks. My approach and dedication reflect my professional and personal mindset. I believe in using technology as a tool for positive change, striving to create solutions that are not only efficient and secure but also accessible and user-friendly.



## 🚀 Why I Love What I Do

- **Problem Solving**: At heart, I'm a problem solver. Whether it's debugging a complex application or finding innovative ways to meet user needs, I thrive on overcoming challenges.
- **Continuous Learning**: The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me on my toes, always learning and adapting to new tools and frameworks.
- **Making an Impact**: I'm driven by the belief that technology can make a difference, improving lives and connecting communities.
